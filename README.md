High-level overview of how it should work.

## 2. Sequence diagram
A simple ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù scenario:  
*Create a Deployment with N replicas ‚Üí Freeze Deployment ‚Üí Unfreeze Deployment after some time.*

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For simplicity, this diagram omits ReplicaSets and HPAs.

## 3. Space identification: what exactly we are doing

We are lucky that Kubernetes architecture is already defined üòÅ  
The core idea is **observation of CREATE / DELETE / EDIT actions** on Kubernetes objects stored in `etcd`.

### VERY SIMPLY:
- Our custom DeploymentFreezer Controller changes Kubernetes objects **via the API Server**.  
- The API Server persists these changes in `etcd`. 
- And then the Kubernetes ecosystem (built-in controllers, scheduler, kubelets) does the appropriate work to apply them in the cluster.
