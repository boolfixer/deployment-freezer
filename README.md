# üöÄ Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) **‚â• 1.24**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) (for local clusters)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

---

### Step 1 ‚Äî Create a test cluster & install CRD

```bash
# Ensure no leftovers from a previous run
kind delete cluster --name df || true

kind create cluster --name df
make install    # applies the DeploymentFreezer CRD
```


### Step 2 ‚Äî Run the controller
```bash
make run
```

### Step 3 ‚Äî Deploy a sample workload & freezer CR
```bash
# Clean up from previous runs (safe if first run)
kubectl delete -f examples/deploymentfreezer-freeze-10s.yaml --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f examples/deployment.yaml --ignore-not-found

kubectl apply -f examples/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f examples/deploymentfreezer-freeze-10s.yaml
```

### Step 4 ‚Äî Verify behavior
```bash
# Immediately after applying: Deployment should be frozen (scaled to 0)
kubectl get deploymentfreezers
kubectl describe deploymentfreezer freeze-web
kubectl get deploy web -o yaml | grep '.spec.replicas'

# Wait ~15 seconds for automatic unfreeze
sleep 15

# After 15 seconds: replicas should be restored to original value
kubectl get deploy web -o yaml | grep '.spec.replicas'
kubectl describe deploymentfreezer freeze-web
```

### Step 5 - e2e tests:
```bash
make test-e2e
```

## 4. Space identification: what exactly we are doing

We are lucky that Kubernetes architecture is already defined üòÅ  
The core idea is **observation of CREATE / DELETE / EDIT actions** on Kubernetes objects stored in `etcd`.

### VERY SIMPLY:
- Our custom DeploymentFreezer Controller changes Kubernetes objects **via the API Server**.  
- The API Server persists these changes in `etcd`. 
- And then the Kubernetes ecosystem (built-in controllers, scheduler, kubelets) does the appropriate work to apply them in the cluster.

## 6. Edge cases: Conditions Matrix
