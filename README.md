*Create a Deployment with N replicas ‚Üí Freeze Deployment ‚Üí Unfreeze Deployment after some time.*

## 3. Space identification: what exactly we are doing

We are lucky that Kubernetes architecture is already defined üòÅ  
The core idea is **observation of CREATE / DELETE / EDIT actions** on Kubernetes objects stored in `etcd`.

### VERY SIMPLY:
- Our custom DeploymentFreezer Controller changes Kubernetes objects **via the API Server**.  
- The API Server persists these changes in `etcd`. 
- And then the Kubernetes ecosystem (built-in controllers, scheduler, kubelets) does the appropriate work to apply them in the cluster.

| Field                         | Type              | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **spec.targetRef.name**       | string            | Name of the target Deployment (must be in the same namespace as this CR).                                              |
| **spec.durationSeconds**      | integer           | Duration of the freeze in seconds. After this period, the operator will unfreeze the Deployment.                       |
| **status.phase**              | string            | High-level lifecycle summary (see [Phase Values](#phase-values)).                                                      |
| **status.observedGeneration** | integer           | Last `metadata.generation` of the CR spec observed by the operator.                                                    |
| **status.targetRef.name**     | string            | Cached name of the target Deployment.                                                                                  |
| **status.targetRef.uid**      | string            | UID of the Deployment when the freeze began (detects if the Deployment was deleted and recreated under the same name). |
| **status.originalReplicas**   | integer           | Number of replicas of the target Deployment before freezing.                                                           |
| **status.freezeUntil**        | RFC3339 timestamp | Absolute time when the Deployment should be unfrozen.                                                                  |
| **status.conditions\[]**      | array             | Fine-grained condition objects representing current state (see [Conditions](#conditions)).                             |

### Phase Values
| Value   | Meaning                                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pending | CR accepted; operator has not yet acted.                                                    |
| Freezing | Deployment is being scaled down.                                                            |
| Frozen  | Deployment is fully frozen (replicas=0) until `freezeUntil`.                                |
| Unfreezing | Deployment is being restored to its original replica count.                                 |
| Completed | Freeze/unfreeze cycle finished successfully.                                                |
| Denied  | Operator refused action (e.g., Deployment already frozen, not found, or multiple freezers). |
| Aborted | Operator stopped due to ownership loss, deletion, or unrecoverable error.                   |
